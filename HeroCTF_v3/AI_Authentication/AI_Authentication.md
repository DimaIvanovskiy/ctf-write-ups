**Description:** 

> Oh my, I hate this company ! They don't stop bragging about how their new authentication system is unbreakable. They claim password have no future.
>
>I'm sure you can prove them wrong. Authenticate as their CEO.

## Solution
Well. Lets take a look at the website. It uses face-recognition for authentication. 

Also it has "About team" page which contains photos of their team.

I just copied image of CEO from this page and showed it to by webcamera from my phone...
